# Filter pipeline contribution

Thanks for contributing your filter pipeline.
You are only a few steps away from making your filter pipeline available to all users of `adaptivefiltering`.
Please go through below checklist.

I have read the following:
* [ ] [The Contribution Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) especially the part w.r.t. copyright.

I have added/edited the following files:

* [ ] At least on `.json` file with a filter pipeline exported by `adaptivefiltering` in the `adaptivefiltering_library` directory.
* [ ] I have added my name to `COPYING.md`

Each filter pipeline that you add should fill the following criteria:

* [ ] It only uses backends that are available in the latest version of `adaptivefiltering`
* [ ] It defines the following metadata
  * [ ] Author
  * [ ] At least one keyword
  * [ ] A short english title
  * [ ] A description (in english) that describes typical use cases
* [ ] If your filter defines end user configuration, each configuration value needs to have an english name

Thanks again for contributing!
